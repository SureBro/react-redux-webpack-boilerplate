# react-redux-webpack-boilerplate #
Boilerplate set up with Koa-React, Babel, ESLint, Redux, Sass, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai, Webpack. **This is still a work in progress**

## Installation and Getting it started ##
1. Clone into your local device with `git clone https://github.com/SureBro/react-redux-webpack-boilerplate.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run webserver` to get your backend started
4. Open a new tab in your terminal and run `npm run dev` to get your frontend started
5. Your app should be running on localhost:8080 unless you changed the port

## Tests ##
This boilerplate is setup with [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) and [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) to handle testing. The main test files should be added to `/app/tests/`. You can have different test files for different modules or components wherever it makes sense but import them here so mocha can use it to test your application. 

To test your application `npm run test`. This will test your app once and close. To **watch** your tests, run `npm run test:watch`. This way your tests will run everytime you edit your code. This might be useful in certain scenarios.

## Project Structure Explanation ##
